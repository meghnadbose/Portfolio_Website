Hi, I’m Meghnad! I’ve worked as a journalist for the past eight years, as a reporter and editor in digital and television newsrooms.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Journalism at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in New York City. I’ll be graduating from the program in August 2024, and will be open to work following that.

This website aims to provide you with an overview of my data journalism experience, including a selection of my published data stories and investigative projects which have extensively used data.

Please contact me at mb5153@columbia.edu in case of any queries.
