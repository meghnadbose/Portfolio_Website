        <p>Over the course of this article, we try to quantify the ‘swingy-ness’ of swing states, or the purpleness or purple states. We will look at how often the states have flipped from one party to the other, how close their elections have been, and how recently they have been swinging - all of it, to arrive at a ranking of the swingy-ness of swing states.</p>

        <h2>The Margin Meter</h2></div>

    <div class="article-text">
        <p>Does the margin of each previous election matter equally? To estimate how swingy a state is today, it would be fair to say that the swingy-ness ‘form’ of a state matters too - hence, let’s give the greatest weightage to the most recent presidential election.</p>
        <p>In our metric, therefore, 2020 was given the most weightage and each election before that was progressively given lesser and lesser weightage.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To do this, the victory margin percentage between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in 2020 was multiplied by 50.</li>
            <li>The victory margin percentage between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in 2016 was multiplied by half of 50, or 25.</li>
            <li>The victory margin percentage between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 was multiplied by half of 25, or 12.5.</li>
            <li>And so on, till the election in 2000 in which George W. Bush beat Al Gore. The victory margin percentage in that election was multiplied by 1.5625.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The sum of these scores for each state gave the Margin Meter score for that state.</p>

        <h2>The Flip Meter</h2></div>

    <div class="article-text">
        <p>How many times has a state flipped from one party to the other in recent presidential elections? Specifically, we’re looking at all presidential elections since 2000, but with the most recent elections weighted the heaviest.</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, if a state flipped in 2020 (compared to 2016), it would get 50 added to its Flip Meter score.</li>
<li>If it flipped in 2016 (compared to 2012), it would get half of 50, or 25, added to its score.</li>
<li>A flip in the 2000 election (compared to 1996) would only lead to an addition of 1.5625 to the score.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sum of these scores for each state gave the Flip Meter score for that state.</p>
