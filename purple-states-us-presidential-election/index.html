        <p>Over the course of this article, we try to quantify the ‘swingy-ness’ of swing states, or the purpleness or purple states. We will look at how often the states have flipped from one party to the other, how close their elections have been, and how recently they have been swinging - all of it, to arrive at a ranking of the swingy-ness of swing states.</p>

        <p>Here's what the analysis revealed.</p>

        <p id="article-text">However, in that same period, there were <b>zero debates</b> on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The economy</li>
            <li>Unemployment</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="article-text">Speaking about the inspiration for his analysis, Verma says, “I had watched the documentary ‘Manufacturing Consent’ in which they talk about how narratives are formed. There is a comparison shown in the film between the amount of newspaper coverage accorded to two different wars. From the time I saw the film, the idea was stuck in my head that to create a narrative, it’s about how much you push something (to viewers). There was also a Vox video I watched on “firehosing of falsehoods.”</p>

        <p id="article-text">The two primetime shows for which data was collected are The Hard Facts with Rahul Shivshankar, and The Right Stand with Anand Narasimhan. <b>None of the 111 primetime videos from these two shows on CNN-News18 fell into the category of 'criticizing the Modi government'.</b> But 21 of the videos were focused on criticizing the Opposition.</p>
